**1 Introduction**

The U.S. CMS Collaboration is committed to empowering its members to develop and achieve their full
potential as excellent and innovative particle physicists. The Collaboration acknowledges  
values that impact all aspects of work by the members of
our community, within HEP and within the wider field of physics. Our vision is that the
U.S. CMS Collaboration, in all of its aspects (including research, operations, and projects), has a working
environment where all members of the Collaboration can thrive and bring in their talents, irrespective of
their dissimilar characteristics. The U.S. CMS working climate is positive, respectful, and supportive of
all.

U.S. CMS workplace culture strives to create and establish an open collaborative environment, which provides a safe, and respectful space
for varied voices and perspectives. Some primary points for evaluation and improvements are community
engagement, career advancement, personnel retention, leadership and decision-making,
In many walks of life it is clear that role models encourage greater participation from people who
see some reflection of themselves in these people. The U.S. CMS collaboration is also committed providing 
a welcoming environment as other scientific fields.
