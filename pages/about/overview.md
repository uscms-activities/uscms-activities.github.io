# Overview

**1 Introduction**

The U.S. CMS Collaboration is committed to empowering its members to develop and achieve their full
potential as excellent and innovative particle physicists. The Collaboration acknowledges that diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI) are fundamental values that impact all aspects of work by the members of
our community, within HEP and within the wider field of physics. Our vision for diversity is that the
U.S. CMS Collaboration, in all of its aspects (including research, operations, and projects), has a working
environment where all members of the Collaboration can thrive and bring in their talents, irrespective of
their dissimilar characteristics. The U.S. CMS working climate is positive, respectful, and supportive of
all.

Our DEI framework is based on examining the U.S. CMS workplace culture and acting to create and
establish an open, inclusive, and collaborative environment, which provides a safe, and respectful space
for diverse voices and perspectives. Some primary points for evaluation and improvements are community
engagement, career advancement, personnel retention, leadership and decision-making,
In many walks of life it is clear that role models encourage greater participation from people who
see some reflection of themselves in these people. The U.S. CMS collaboration is also committed to the
representation of women and historically underrepresented groups and will proactively work to ensure
that, in fact and in perception, the experiment provides just as welcoming an environment as other
scientific fields.

**2 Defining Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

As stated in the CMS Code of Conduct [1], “The CMS collaboration consists of members with varied
national origin, ethnic background, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender, age, physical ability,
and religion. As a community, we are committed to being positive and inclusive in all regards.” As
the largest single national organization within the CMS collaboration, we as U.S CMS share the same
commitments towards diversity and inclusion.

**2.1 Diversity**

For the purpose of this plan, “diversity” embraces the uniqueness of each individual. It refers to all of the
"visible" personal attributes listed in the Code of Conduct. In addition, it includes the "invisible" as-
pects (e.g. work experience, educational background, geographic location, socioeconomic status, parental
status), some of which are listed in the CMS Code of Conduct.

**2.2 Equity**

The U.S. CMS Collaboration acknowledges that we do not all start from the same place, and need to
make adjustments to overcome imbalances by redistribution of support and resources. Realizing equity
leads to equal access to opportunities. Equity in a workplace ensures dignified treatment of all. The
U.S. CMS collaboration is committed to identifying and creating structures and opportunities in order
to disrupt unintentional barriers arising from systemic biases that disproportionately affect historically
underrepresented groups. This acknowledges historical oppression and discrimination that have prevented
certain groups of people from having access to resources and being able to participate fully within HEP
and the wider field of physics.

**2.3 Inclusion**

Inclusion refers to how diversity is leveraged to create an equitable, high-performing environment. The
commitment of the U.S. CMS collaboration to inclusion means to sustain a culture in which each indi-
vidual is respected and has equal standing as a valued member of the collaboration. The collaboration
aims to ensure that all members of the community feel welcomed, involved, engaged and empowered.
